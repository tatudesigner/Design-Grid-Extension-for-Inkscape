## ü§î Why This Extension Was Created

While Inkscape offers tools for creating grids with guides, they can sometimes feel unintuitive and clutter the workspace. Inspired by the sleek grid generation feature in tools like Figma, I wanted to develop something similar for Inkscape‚Äî**modern, clean, and intuitive**. This extension ensures that even novice users can easily generate functional and visually appealing grids for their designs.

The Design Grid fills the gap, providing an easy-to-use solution for quickly generating custom grids, saving time, and ensuring design consistency.
